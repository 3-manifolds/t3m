Virtually all of the kernel documentation is contained
in the source code itself.  If you're not sure where
to begin, you should

(1)	Read SnapPea.h.	This is technically not part of the
	kernel, but rather the protocol for how the kernel
	and the UI should communicate.

(2)	Read triangulation.h.  It describes the data structure
	which SnapPea uses to pass manifolds from one module
	to another.

(3)	Read the source code in the files of greatest interest
	to you.  Triangulation.h makes extensive references
	to what is found where in the remaining code.

Please see detab.c for information on getting the tab
stops to look right on a unix machine.
